            Once upon a time, the earth was just a hot, molten ball of fire. But
            as it cooled, the continents took shape and the oceans arose. The
            ocean was born from the rain that fell on the young earth and was
            slowly gathered into vast bodies of water. Over millions of years,
            the ocean gave birth to countless species of animals and plants,

            body of water, but a vital part of the earth that sustains life. It
            provides the air we breathe, the weather patterns that shape our
            world, and the food we eat. It also supports countless industries,
